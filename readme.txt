== Important Notice ==

**Important Things That You Should Know**
* The plugin will be constantly contacting our servers to fetch the relevant settings of our bar. This means two things. First one is that you don't have to take any trouble saving your bar settings or uploading any files that will build the bar. Second and important thing is that it happens very rarely on earth, when our servers are down but still if our servers are down then the bar will automatically be disable for that period of time (which is very less obviously).

* As the bar is generated from our end and the settings will be saved by us only, this means that every user taking benefit from it has to create an account at http://dev.pluginstalk.com or at any of our network websites.
